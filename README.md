# KarateEducation
Karate is an open-source general-purpose test-automation framework that can script calls to HTTP end-points and assert that the JSON or XML responses are as expected. Karate is implemented in Java but test-scripts are written in Gherkin since Karate was originally an extension of the Cucumber framework.
